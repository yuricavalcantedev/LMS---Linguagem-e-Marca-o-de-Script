		<div id="verse">
			<p><strong>1.</strong> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <strong>2.</strong> The same was in the beginning with God. <strong>3.</strong> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. <strong>4.</strong> In him was life; and the life was the light of men. <strong>5.</strong> And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. <br>
			<strong>6.</strong> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <strong>7.</strong> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. <strong>8.</strong> He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. <strong>9.</strong> That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<br>
			<strong>10.</strong> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. <strong>11.</strong> He came unto his own, and his own received him not. <strong>12.</strong> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the <ins>sons</ins> of God, even to them that believe on his name: <strong>13.</strong> Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br>
			<strong>14.</strong> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the <em style="color:rgb(64,0,255);">Father</em>,) full of grace and truth.<br>
			<strong>15.</strong> John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
			<strong>16.</strong> And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. <strong>17.</strong> For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. <strong>18.</strong> No man hath seen <em>God</em> at any time; the only begotten <ins>Son</ins>, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<br>
